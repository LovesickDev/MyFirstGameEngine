USE WORD WRAP.

like all my personal projects, i use Github to host my code. i have always used Github Desktop to make it easy for me to send over files, but I have decided to not install it on my new computer to familiarize myself with the Git command line program. 

To initialize a project:
1. Create a README.md (optional)
    echo "# MyFirstGameEngine" >> README.md
2. Initalize the repo
    git init
3. Add README.md as a file to monitor
    git add README.md
4. Make your first  (-m = message)
    git commit -m "First Commit"
5. Move/Rename branch to main
    git branch -M main
6. Add the GitHub origin/destination
    git remote add origin [URL.git]
7. Push your commit
    git push -u origin main
